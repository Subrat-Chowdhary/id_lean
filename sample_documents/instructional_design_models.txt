- Analysis: Identify learning needs, goals, and audience characteristics
- Design: Create learning objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
- Development: Create and produce learning materials and content
- Implementation: Deliver the instruction to learners
- Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of the instruction

SAM (Successive Approximation Model):
- Preparation: Gather information and define project scope
- Iterative Design: Create prototypes and refine through cycles
- Iterative Development: Build and test small portions repeatedly

Bloom's Taxonomy:
- Remember: Recall facts and basic concepts
- Understand: Explain ideas or concepts
- Apply: Use information in new situations
- Analyze: Draw connections among ideas
- Evaluate: Justify a stand or decision

4. Present the content
5. Provide learning guidance
6. Elicit performance
7. Provide feedback
8. Assess performance
9. Enhance retention and transfer

Learning Objectives Guidelines:
